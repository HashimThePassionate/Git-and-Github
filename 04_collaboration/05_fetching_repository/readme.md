**Before Changes in Remote Repository:**
```bash
git log --oneline --all --graph
* 123abc (HEAD -> main, origin/main) Initial commit
```

1. **Remote Repository Changes:**
   - Someone makes changes to the README file directly on the GitHub repository.

2. **Fetch Changes to Local Repository:**
   ```
   git fetch origin
   ```

   This command fetches the latest changes from the remote repository (`origin`), including any changes made to branches. However, it does not automatically merge these changes into your local branch.

3. **View the Changes:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --all --graph
   * 123abc (HEAD -> main, origin/main) Initial commit
   * 456def (origin/main) Updated README file
   ```

   The `git log` command shows that there is a new commit (`456def`) on the `origin/main` branch, indicating that the README file was updated.

4. **Merge Changes into Local Branch:**
   ```
   git merge origin/main
   ```

   This command merges the changes from the `origin/main` branch into your current local branch (typically `main`).

**After Merging Changes in Local Repository:**
```bash
git log --oneline --all --graph
*   abc123 (HEAD -> main) Merge branch 'origin/main' into main
|\  
| * 456def (origin/main) Updated README file
|/  
* 123abc (origin/main) Initial commit
```

Explanation:
- The `git merge origin/main` command merges the changes from the `origin/main` branch into your local `main` branch.
- A new merge commit (`abc123`) is created, combining the changes from both branches.
- Now, your local repository is up to date with the changes made in the remote repository.
