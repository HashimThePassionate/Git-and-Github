Sure, let's walk through a scenario where Bob and Alice are both working directly on the main branch. They each make changes, push to the main branch, and encounter a conflict. Bob resolves the conflict using the GitHub graphical interface.

### Scenario Steps:

#### 1. Clone the repository:
Both Bob and Alice clone the repository to their local machines.

```sh
git https://github.com/hashimthepassionate/mars.git MarsProject
cd MarsProject
```

#### 2. Bob and Alice work on the main branch:
They both make changes directly on the main branch.

```sh
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Alice's changes"
git push origin main
```

```sh
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Bob's changes"
git push origin main
```

#### 3. Conflict occurs on Bob's side:
When Bob pushes his changes, there's a conflict because Alice has also made changes to the same part of the code.

#### 4. Bob resolves the conflict using GitHub:
Bob navigates to the repository on GitHub and opens a pull request for his changes.

#### 5. Bob resolves the conflict using the GitHub interface:
Bob goes to his pull request on GitHub, where he sees the conflict indicated. He clicks on the "Resolve conflicts" button.

#### 6. Bob resolves the conflict:
GitHub provides a text editor where Bob can resolve the conflict. He makes the necessary changes, then commits the resolution directly on GitHub.

#### 7. Bob's pull request is merged:
Once the conflict is resolved and Bob's changes are reviewed, his pull request is merged into the main branch.

### Summary:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Bob and Alice work on the main branch, making changes directly.
3. Conflict occurs when Bob pushes his changes.
4. Bob opens a pull request for his changes on GitHub.
5. Bob resolves the conflict using the GitHub interface.
6. Bob makes the necessary changes and commits the resolution on GitHub.
7. Bob's pull request is merged into the main branch.
