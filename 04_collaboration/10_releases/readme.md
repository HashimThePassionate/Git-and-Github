### Step 1: Create a Tag for the Release

1. **Create the Tag:**
   - If you haven't already created the tag `v1.0`, do so using:
     ```sh
     git tag v1.0
     ```

2. **Push the Tag to the Remote Repository:**
   - Push the tag to the remote repository:
     ```sh
     git push origin v1.0
     ```

### Step 2: Create a Release on GitHub

1. **Navigate to Your Repository on GitHub:**
   - Open your web browser and go to your GitHub repository.

2. **Go to the "Releases" Section:**
   - Click on the "Releases" link located typically near the top of the repository page or in the right-hand sidebar.

3. **Create a New Release:**
   - Click the "Draft a new release" button.

4. **Fill in the Release Information:**
   - **Tag version:** Select `v1.0` from the dropdown list (it should be pre-populated with the tag you pushed earlier).
   - **Release title:** Enter a title for your release, such as "Version 1.0".
   - **Description:** Provide a description of the release. This can include highlights, new features, bug fixes, and any other relevant information.
   - **Optional Files:** If you have any binaries or additional files to include with the release, you can upload them by dragging and dropping or using the "Attach binaries by dropping them here or selecting them" area.

5. **Publish the Release:**
   - Once you've filled in all the necessary details, click the "Publish release" button.

### Step 3: Verify the Release

1. **Check the Releases Page:**
   - After publishing, you should be redirected to the releases page where you can see the newly created release `v1.0`.

2. **Verify the Tag and Release:**
   - Ensure that the release information and tag are correct. The release should be associated with the `v1.0` tag and include all the details you entered.
