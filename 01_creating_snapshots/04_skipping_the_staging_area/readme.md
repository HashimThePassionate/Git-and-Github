## Skipping the Staging Area and Committing Changes

### 1. Make Changes to Files
First, make the necessary changes to the files in your working directory. For example, let's append the word "python" to `file1.txt`.

```bash
echo python >> file1.txt
```

### 2. Commit Changes Directly
To skip the staging area and commit all modified files directly, you can use the `-am` flags with `git commit`. This will automatically stage any tracked files that have been modified and commit them with the provided message.

```bash
git commit -am "Add and commit"
```

### Note:
- **Use with Caution**: Only use this approach when you're certain that you don't need to review the changes before committing. It's convenient for quickly committing changes, but it bypasses the opportunity to review individual changes.
- **For Tracked Files**: This command will only commit changes to tracked files. Untracked files will not be committed.

### Summary
- Make changes to the files in your working directory.
- Use `git commit -am "message"` to skip the staging area and commit all modified tracked files directly.

By following these steps, you can quickly commit changes to your Git repository without staging them first.
