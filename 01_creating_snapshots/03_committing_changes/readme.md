## Committing Changes in Git

### 1. Commit with a Message Inline
You can commit changes and add a commit message inline using the `-m` flag with `git commit`.

```bash
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
```

### 2. Commit with a Detailed Message
If you prefer to provide a detailed commit message along with a description, simply use `git commit` without the `-m` flag.

```bash
git commit
```
This will open a default editor (usually Vim or Nano) where you can type your commit message. Once you've added your message, save and close the editor to complete the commit.

### Summary
- Use `git commit -m "message"` to commit changes with a brief message inline.
- Use `git commit` to open an editor and add a detailed commit message.

By following these steps, you can commit changes to your Git repository along with meaningful commit messages.
