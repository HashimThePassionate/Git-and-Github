## Git Status Short and Detailed

### Overview
This README provides a quick guide on using `git status` commands to check the status of your repository, along with explanations and examples.

### Steps

1. **Check Short Status**: 
    ```bash
    git status -s 
    ```
    - This command provides a concise overview of the changes in the working directory.

2. **Append Content to a File**:
    ```bash
    echo sky >> moon/main.js
    ```
    - Appends "sky" to the end of `main.js`.

3. **Create a New File**:
    ```bash
    echo mountains > moon/file2.js
    ```
    - Creates a new file `file2.js` inside the `moon` directory with the content "mountains".

4. **Check Detailed Status**:
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    - This command provides a detailed view of modified and untracked files.

5. **Check Short Status Again**:
    ```bash
    git status -s
    ```
    - Returns a brief status summary similar to:
    ```
    M moon/main.js
    ?? moon/file.js
    ```
    - "M" indicates `main.js` is modified and "??" indicates an untracked file.

6. **Add Modified File to Staging Area**:
    ```bash
    git add moon/main.js
    ```
    - Adds `main.js` to the staging area.

7. **Check Short Status After Staging**:
    ```bash
    git status -s
    ```
    - Returns a status summary indicating the staged modifications:
    ```
    M  moon/main.js 
    ?? moon/file.js
    ```
    - The "M" in green indicates changes staged for commit.

8. **Append More Content to the File**:
    ```bash
    echo river >> moon/main.js
    ```
    - Appends "river" to `main.js`.

9. **Check Short Status Again**:
    ```bash
    git status -s
    ```
    - Returns a status summary with modified indicators:
    ```
    MM moon/main.js
    ?? moon/file.js
    ```
    - The first "M" in green indicates changes staged for commit, the second "M" in red indicates modifications not staged.

10. **Add Modified File Again**:
    ```bash
    git add moon/main.js
    ```
    - Adds the modified `main.js` to the staging area again.

11. **Check Short Status Once More**:
    ```bash
    git status -s
    ```
    - Returns a status summary after adding to the staging area:
    ```
    M  moon/main.js
    ?? moon/file.js
    ```

12. **Add New File to Staging Area**:
    ```bash
    git add moon/file2.js
    ```
    - Adds `file2.js` to the staging area.

13. **Check Short Status After Adding New File**:
    ```bash
    git status -s
    ```
    - Returns a status summary after adding the new file to the staging area:
    ```
    A  moon/file.js
    M  moon/main.js
    ```
    - "A" indicates `file.js` is added to the staging area, while "M" indicates `main.js` is modified and staged.
