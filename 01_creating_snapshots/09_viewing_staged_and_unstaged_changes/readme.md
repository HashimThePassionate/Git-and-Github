## Viewing Staged and Unstaged Changes

### Overview
This section explains how to view the differences between staged (added but not committed) and unstaged (untracked or modified) changes in your repository using `git diff`.

### Steps

1. **View Staged Changes**:
    ```bash
    git diff --staged
    ```
    - This command compares the changes between the last commit and the staging area. It shows differences for files that have been added to the staging area but not yet committed.

2. **Compare Staging Copy with Old Copy**:
    - The `git diff --staged` command allows you to easily compare the version of the file in the staging area with the version in the last commit.

3. **View Unstaged Changes**:
    ```bash
    git diff
    ```
    - This command compares the changes between the working directory and the staging area. It shows differences for files that have been modified but not yet staged, as well as untracked files.

4. **Compare Untracked or Unstaging Changes**:
    - Running `git diff` without any additional arguments compares the untracked or unstaged changes in the working directory with the version in the staging area.
