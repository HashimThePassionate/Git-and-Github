# Git Fundamentals

## Creating Snapshots

Git is a powerful version control system that allows you to create snapshots of your project at different points in time. Below are some fundamental concepts you'll learn about creating snapshots in Git:

1. **Initializing**: Initialize a new Git repository in your project directory to start tracking changes.

2. **Staging Files**: Use the staging area to prepare files for the next commit. 

3. **Committing Changes**: Commit your staged changes to the repository, creating a snapshot of your project at that moment.

4. **Skipping Staging Area**: Directly commit changes without staging them first.

5. **Removing Files**: Remove files from both your working directory and the Git repository.

6. **Renaming or Removing Files**: Rename or remove files while maintaining their history in Git.

7. **Ignoring Files**: Configure Git to ignore certain files or directories, such as temporary files or build artifacts.

8. **Short Status**: Check the current status of your repository in a concise format.

9. **Viewing Staged and Unstaged Changes**: View the differences between the files in your working directory, the staging area, and the last commit.

10. **Visual Diff Tools**: Utilize visual diff tools to compare changes between different versions of files.

11. **Viewing Commit History**: Explore the history of commits in your repository to understand how your project has evolved over time.

12. **Viewing a Commit Exactly**: Examine the details of a specific commit, including the changes it introduced.

13. **Unstaging Files**: Remove files from the staging area without discarding their changes.

14. **Discard Local Changes**: Discard changes to files in your working directory, reverting them to the last committed version.

15. **Restoring a File to an Earlier Version**: Restore a file to a previous state, either from a specific commit or a previous version.

By mastering these concepts, you'll have a solid understanding of how to manage snapshots and track changes effectively in Git.
