## Visual Diff Tools

### Overview
This section outlines the process of configuring and using Visual Diff Tools, with VS Code as an example, for comparing files side by side.

### Steps

1. **Configure Global Diff Tool**:
    ```bash
    git config --global diff.tool vscode
    ```
    - This command sets the default visual diff tool globally to VS Code. You can replace `vscode` with any other preferred diff tool name.

2. **Set VS Code as Diff Tool**:
    ```bash
    git config --global difftool.vscode.cmd "code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE"
    ```
    - This command configures VS Code as the diff tool for Git. The provided command will open VS Code, wait until it's closed, and compare the `$LOCAL` (old copy) and `$REMOTE` (new copy) files side by side.

3. **Open Global Git Configuration for Editing**:
    ```bash
    git config --global -e
    ```
    - This command opens the global Git configuration file in the default editor (which is now VS Code, as configured).

4. **Use Visual Diff Tool for Unstaged Changes**:
    ```bash
    git difftool
    ```
    - This command opens the configured visual diff tool (VS Code) to compare unstaged changes in your working directory.

5. **Compare Staged Changes**:
    ```bash
    git difftool --staged
    ```
    - This command opens the visual diff tool (VS Code) to compare changes that are staged but not yet committed.
