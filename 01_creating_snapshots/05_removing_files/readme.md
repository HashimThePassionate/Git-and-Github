## Removing Files in Git

### 1. Remove File from Directory
First, remove the file from the directory using the appropriate system command. For example, to remove `file2.txt`, you can use the `rm` command.

```bash
rm file2.txt
```

### 2. Check Staging Area
Check the status of your repository to verify that the file is still staged for deletion.

```bash
git status
```

### 3. Remove from Staging Area
If the file is still staged for deletion, you can remove it from the staging area using `git add`. This will unstage the file.

```bash
git add file2.txt
```

### 4. Commit Changes
Commit the removal of the file with an appropriate commit message.

```bash
git commit -m "Remove file2.txt"
```

### 5. Check Staging Area Again
Verify that the file is no longer staged for deletion by listing the files in the staging area.

```bash
git ls-files
```

### Using `git rm` Command
Alternatively, you can use the `git rm` command to remove a file from both the directory and the staging area in one step.

```bash
git rm file2.txt
```

### Summary
- Remove the file from the directory using system commands like `rm`.
- Use `git add` to remove the file from the staging area if necessary.
- Commit the changes to finalize the removal.
- Optionally, you can use `git rm` to remove the file from both the directory and the staging area in one step.

By following these steps, you can effectively remove files from both the directory and staging area in your Git repository.
