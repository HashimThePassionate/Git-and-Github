## Viewing Commit History

### Overview
This section explains how to view the commit history of a Git repository using various options of the `git log` command.

### Steps

1. **Comprehensive Commit History**:
    ```bash
    git log
    ```
    - This command displays a comprehensive commit history, showing details such as commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

2. **Shortened Commit History**:
    ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```
    - This command provides a shorter version of the commit history, displaying each commit as a single line with abbreviated commit hashes and commit messages.

3. **Shortened Commit History in Reverse Order**:
    ```bash
    git log --oneline --reverse
    ```
    - This command displays a shortened commit history in reverse order, starting from the oldest commits first.
