#### Step 3: Add New Features with Branches

5. **Create a New Branch for a Feature:**
   - Create a new branch named `feature/add-timer`.
   - Switch to this branch.

   **Deliverable:** Submit the commands used and the output of `git branch`.

6. **Implement the Timer Feature:**
   - In the `feature/add-timer` branch, add a timer to the quiz in `app.js` that limits the time to answer each question.
   - Update `index.html` and `style.css` as needed.

   **Deliverable:** Submit the updated `app.js`, `index.html`, and `style.css`.

7. **Commit the Timer Feature:**
   - Commit the changes for the timer feature in the `feature/add-timer` branch.

   **Deliverable:** Submit the commands used and the output of `git log`.

8. **Create Another Branch for Another Feature:**
   - Create a new branch named `feature/add-score-tracking`.
   - Switch to this branch.

   **Deliverable:** Submit the commands used and the output of `git branch`.

9. **Implement the Score Tracking Feature:**
   - In the `feature/add-score-tracking` branch, add functionality to track and display the user's score in `app.js`.
   - Update `index.html` and `style.css` as needed.

   **Deliverable:** Submit the updated `app.js`, `index.html`, and `style.css`.

10. **Commit the Score Tracking Feature:**
    - Commit the changes for the score tracking feature in the `feature/add-score-tracking` branch.

    **Deliverable:** Submit the commands used and the output of `git log`.

#### Step 4: Merge Features into Main Branch

11. **Merge the Timer Feature:**
    - Switch to the `main` branch.
    - Merge the `feature/add-timer` branch into `main`.

    **Deliverable:** Submit the commands used and the output of `git log`.

12. **Resolve Any Merge Conflicts (if any):**
    - If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them and complete the merge.

    **Deliverable:** Submit the resolved files and the commands used.

13. **Merge the Score Tracking Feature:**
    - Switch to the `main` branch.
    - Merge the `feature/add-score-tracking` branch into `main`.

    **Deliverable:** Submit the commands used and the output of `git log`.

14. **Resolve Any Merge Conflicts (if any):**
    - If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them and complete the merge.

    **Deliverable:** Submit the resolved files and the commands used.

#### Step 5: Push Changes to GitHub

15. **Push All Changes to GitHub:**
    - Push the `main` branch with all merged features to GitHub.

    **Deliverable:** Submit the command used and a screenshot of the updated repository on GitHub.

### Submission:
Submit all required deliverables (files, commands, outputs, screenshots, and URLs) as a single document or archive. Ensure each step is clearly labeled with the corresponding deliverable.

This practical quiz will give users hands-on experience with Git branching, merging, and GitHub collaboration while building a functional JavaScript quiz application.
