3. **Initiate an Interactive Rebase to Drop Commits:**
   ```sh
   git rebase -i 559ca3d^
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   CONFLICT (modify/delete): terms.txt deleted in HEAD and modified in d3ee50e (Update terms of service and Google Map SDK version.).  Version d3ee50e (Update terms of service and Google Map SDK version.) of terms.txt left in tree.
   error: could not apply d3ee50e... Update terms of service and Google Map SDK version.
   hint: Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
   hint: "git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
   hint: You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
   hint: To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".
   Could not apply d3ee50e... Update terms of service and Google Map SDK version.
   ```

4. **Check Status and Resolve Conflicts:**
   ```sh
   git status -s
   git mergetool
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   M  package.txt
   DU terms.txt
   ```

5. **Continue the Rebase Process:**
   ```sh
   git rebase --continue
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/master.
   ```

6. **View the Updated Commit History:**
   ```sh
   git log --oneline --all --graph
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   * 04bf4af (HEAD -> master) Render cafes on the maps
   * ea73870 Reverting bad code
   * 3abdc41 WIP
   * 453f9e0 Update terms of service and Google Map SDK version.

In this scenario, you attempted to drop commits using an interactive rebase but encountered a conflict that needed manual resolution. After resolving the conflict, you continued the rebase process, successfully dropping the commits and updating the commit history.
