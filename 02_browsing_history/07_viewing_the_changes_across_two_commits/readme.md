## Viewing Changes Across Two Commits

### Introduction
Git allows you to compare the changes between two commits using the `git diff` command. This section demonstrates how to view the differences between the last two commits.

### Viewing Detailed Changes

#### 1. `git diff HEAD~2 HEAD`
- Displays the differences between the commit located two steps before the current HEAD (HEAD~2) and the current HEAD.
- This includes the changes made to each file in the repository.

### Viewing Changes Summary

#### 2. `git diff HEAD~2 HEAD --name-only`
- Shows only the names of the files that were modified between the two specified commits.
- Useful for quickly identifying the files affected by the changes without displaying the actual differences.

#### 3. `git diff HEAD~2 HEAD --name-status`
- Provides a summary of the changes between the two specified commits, including the names of the modified files and the status of each change (modified, added, deleted).

### Conclusion
Using the `git diff` command with appropriate options, you can compare the changes between two commits and gain insights into how the codebase has evolved over time. Whether you need a detailed view of the changes or just a summary of the affected files, Git provides flexibility to meet your requirements.
