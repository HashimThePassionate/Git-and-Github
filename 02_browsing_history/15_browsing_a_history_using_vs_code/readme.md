To browse a Git history using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you can follow these steps:

1. **Open VS Code**: Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.

2. **Open Project**: Open the project folder that contains the Git repository you want to browse. You can do this by either selecting "Open Folder" from the File menu or by dragging the folder into the VS Code window.

3. **Open Source Control**: In the Activity Bar on the side of the window, click on the Source Control icon (it looks like a branch). This will open the Source Control view.

4. **View Git History**: Within the Source Control view, you'll see a list of changed files and a toolbar at the top. Click on the clock icon with the arrow pointing downwards. This is the "View History" button. Clicking it will open a new panel showing the Git history of the repository.

5. **Navigate Commits**: In the Git History panel, you'll see a list of commits with the most recent one at the top. You can click on any commit to view its details, including the commit message, author, and the files changed in that commit.

6. **Compare Commits**: To compare different commits, you can select two commits by holding down the Ctrl key (Cmd on macOS) and clicking on the commits you want to compare. VS Code will then show you the differences between the selected commits, highlighting the changes in the code.

7. **View File History**: You can also view the history of a specific file by right-clicking on the file in the Explorer view or in the editor and selecting "Git: View File History" from the context menu. This will show you all the commits that have affected that file and allow you to navigate through its history.

By following these steps, you can easily browse the Git history of your project using Visual Studio Code.
