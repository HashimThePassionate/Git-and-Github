## Viewing the History of a File

### Introduction
Git allows you to view the commit history of a specific file, providing insights into its evolution over time. This section demonstrates how to use `git log` to explore the history of a file.

### Viewing Commit History

#### 1. `git log <file-name>`
- Displays the commit history of the specified file.
- This includes information about each commit that modified the file, such as the commit message, author, date, and commit hash.

#### 2. `git log --oneline <file-name>`
- Shows a condensed version of the commit history for the specified file, displaying only the abbreviated commit hash and commit message in a single line for each commit.
- Useful for quickly scanning through the commit history of a file.

### Conclusion
By using `git log` with the appropriate file name, you can explore the commit history of a specific file in a Git repository. This allows you to track changes, understand when and why modifications were made, and collaborate effectively on file-based tasks within your project.
