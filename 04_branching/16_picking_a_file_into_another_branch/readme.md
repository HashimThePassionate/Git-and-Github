# Picking a file into another branch

1. **Explanation of the Task:**
   The task involves picking the latest changes made to a file in another branch without performing a full commit. This could be useful if you want to selectively incorporate changes from one branch into another without committing the changes on the target branch.

2. **Git Commands:**
   ```git
   git switch -C send-mail
   ```
   This command switches to the `send-mail` branch. The `-C` option is used to create the branch if it doesn't exist.

   ```bash
   echo river >> toc.txt
   ```
   This command appends the word "river" to the `toc.txt` file.

   ```git
   git commit -am "river"
   ```
   This command stages all changes to tracked files and commits them with the message "river".

   ```git
   git switch master
   ```
   This command switches back to the `master` branch.

   ```git
   git restore --source=send-mail -- toc.txt
   ```
   This command restores the `toc.txt` file from the `send-mail` branch without committing the changes to the `master` branch. The `--source` option specifies the branch to copy the changes from.

3. **Output:**
   There won't be any output displayed for the individual commands, but the `toc.txt` file will have the changes from the `send-mail` branch (the addition of "river") incorporated into the `master` branch without a full commit. The changes will be applied directly to the working directory.

This sequence of commands effectively transfers the latest changes made to `toc.txt` in the `send-mail` branch to the `master` branch without creating a new commit on the `master` branch.
