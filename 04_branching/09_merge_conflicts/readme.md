## Merge conflict:

1. **Creating and Making Changes in Feature Branch:**

    Commands:
    ```bash
    git switch -C feature/change-password
    code password.txt  # Assuming this opens the file in an editor
    ```

    Explanation:
    This creates a new branch named `feature/change-password` and opens the `password.txt` file for editing. Assuming you've added "change in the bugfix branch" to `password.txt`.

2. **Staging Changes in Feature Branch:**

    Commands:
    ```bash
    git status -s
    git add .
    git commit -m "Change password updated"
    ```

    Explanation:
    - `git status -s`: Checks the status of the working directory and staged changes.
    - `git add .`: Stages all changes.
    - `git commit -m "Change password updated"`: Commits the changes to the feature branch.

3. **Switching Back to Master and Making Changes:**

    Commands:
    ```bash
    git switch master
    code password.txt  # Assuming this opens the file in an editor
    ```

    Explanation:
    This switches back to the `master` branch and opens the `password.txt` file for editing. Assuming you've added "change in the bugfix branch" to `password.txt`.

4. **Staging Changes in Master Branch:**

    Commands:
    ```bash
    git status -s
    git add .
    git commit -m "Change password updated"
    ```

    Explanation:
    - `git status -s`: Checks the status of the working directory and staged changes.
    - `git add .`: Stages all changes.
    - `git commit -m "Change password updated"`: Commits the changes to the `master` branch.

5. **Merging Feature Branch into Master:**

    Commands:
    ```bash
    git merge feature/change-password
    ```

    Output:
    ```plaintext
    Auto-merging password.txt
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in password.txt
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
    ```

    Explanation:
    A merge conflict occurred because changes were made to the same file (`password.txt`) on both branches (`master` and `feature/change-password`).

6. **Viewing Merge Conflict Status:**

    Command:
    ```bash
    git status
    ```

    Output:
    ```plaintext
     On branch master
    You have unmerged paths.
      (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
      (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

    Unmerged paths:
      (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
            both modified:   password.txt
    ```

    Explanation:
    Git indicates that there are unmerged paths, and it lists the conflicted file (`password.txt`).

7. **Resolving Merge Conflict:**

    Commands:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Accept both changes"
    ```

    Explanation:
    - `git add .`: Stages the resolved changes.
    - `git commit -m "Accept both changes"`: Commits the resolved changes, accepting both changes from the conflicting branches.
