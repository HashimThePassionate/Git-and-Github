Sure, let's create a scenario where two people (Alice and Bob) are collaborating on a Git repository. We'll walk through the process of creating a new branch on the remote, fetching it locally, setting up tracking branches, and collaborating by pulling and pushing changes. Finally, we'll prune remote-tracking branches.

### Scenario Steps

#### 1. Create a Branch on the Remote Repository
Assume Alice is creating a new branch called `feature/new-feature` on the remote repository.

```sh
# Alice creates a new branch on the remote repository
git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/feature/new-feature
```

This command pushes the current branch (`HEAD`) to a new branch called `feature/new-feature` on the remote (`origin`).

#### 2. Fetch the New Branch Locally
Both Alice and Bob need to fetch the new branch to their local repositories.

```sh
# Alice fetches the new branch
git fetch origin feature/new-feature

# Bob fetches the new branch
git fetch origin feature/new-feature
```

#### 3. Create and Track the New Branch Locally
Alice and Bob create a local branch and set it to track the remote branch `feature/new-feature`.

```sh
# Alice creates and tracks the new branch
git switch -C feature/new-feature -t origin/feature/new-feature

# Bob creates and tracks the new branch
git switch -C feature/new-feature -t origin/feature/new-feature
```

The `-t` option is shorthand for `--track`, which sets up the local branch to track the specified remote branch.

#### 4. Collaborate by Pulling and Pushing Changes
Alice and Bob can now make changes, commit them, and push/pull to collaborate.

**Alice makes a change:**
```sh
# Alice makes some changes
git add .
git commit -m "Alice's changes to new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

**Bob pulls Alice's changes and makes his own:**
```sh
# Bob pulls Alice's changes
git pull origin feature/new-feature

# Bob makes some changes
git add .
git commit -m "Bob's changes to new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

**Alice pulls Bob's changes:**
```sh
# Alice pulls Bob's changes
git pull origin feature/new-feature
```

#### 5. Prune Remote-Tracking Branches
When branches are deleted on the remote, it's good practice to prune the local repository to clean up stale references.

**Delete the remote branch:**
Assume the feature is completed, and the branch `feature/new-feature` is deleted from the remote.

```sh
# Alice deletes the remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/new-feature
```

**Prune the remote-tracking branches:**
Both Alice and Bob should prune their local repositories.

```sh
# Alice prunes her remote-tracking branches
git fetch -p

# Bob prunes his remote-tracking branches
git fetch -p
```

The `-p` option for `git fetch` is shorthand for `--prune`, which removes references to remote-tracking branches that no longer exist on the remote.

### Summary of Commands

Here's the sequence of commands used:

**Alice creates a remote branch:**
```sh
git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/feature/new-feature
```

**Alice and Bob fetch the new branch:**
```sh
git fetch origin feature/new-feature
```

**Alice and Bob create and track the new branch:**
```sh
git switch -t feature/new-feature origin/feature/new-feature
```

**Alice makes changes:**
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Alice's changes to new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

**Bob pulls changes and makes his own:**
```sh
git pull origin feature/new-feature
git add .
git commit -m "Bob's changes to new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

**Alice pulls Bob's changes:**
```sh
git pull origin feature/new-feature
```

**Alice deletes the remote branch:**
```sh
git push origin --delete feature/new-feature
```

**Alice and Bob prune their local repositories:**
```sh
git fetch -p
```
