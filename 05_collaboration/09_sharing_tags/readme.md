### Step 1: Create a Tag for the Last Commit

1. **Create the Tag:**
   - Use the `git tag` command to create a new tag `v1.0` for the last commit:
     ```sh
     git tag v1.0
     ```

2. **Verify the Tag:**
   - To verify that the tag has been created, you can list all tags:
     ```bash
     git tag
     ```
   - You should see `v1.0` in the list of tags.

### Step 2: Push the Tag to the Remote Repository

1. **Push the Tag:**
   - Use the `git push` command to push the tag to the remote repository:
     ```sh
     git push origin v1.0
     ```

2. **Verify the Tag on the Remote:**
   - You can verify that the tag has been pushed to the remote repository by checking the tags on the GitHub repository web interface or by fetching and listing tags:
     ```bash
     git fetch --tags
     git tag
     ```

### Step 3: Delete the Tag from the Remote Repository

1. **Delete the Tag Locally:**
   - Optionally, delete the tag locally (this is not required to delete it from the remote):
     ```bash
     git tag -d v1.0
     ```

2. **Delete the Tag from the Remote:**
   - Use the `git push` command to delete the tag from the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin --delete v1.0
     ```

### Step 4: Verify the Tag Deletion

1. **Fetch Tags and Verify:**
   - Fetch tags from the remote to ensure the tag has been deleted:
     ```bash
     git fetch --tags
     git tag
     ```
   - You should no longer see `v1.0` in the list of tags.
