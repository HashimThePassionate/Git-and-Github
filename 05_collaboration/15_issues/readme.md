#### Issue Title:
Implement User Authentication

#### Description:
**Problem:**
Currently, our application lacks user authentication, leaving sensitive data and functionalities exposed to unauthorized users.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to any restricted area of the application.
2. No authentication prompt or access control mechanism is in place.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and integrate it with our existing user management system.
- Utilize a library such as `jsonwebtoken` for token generation and verification.
- Implement middleware to protect routes that require authentication.
- Provide endpoints for user login and registration.
- Store user credentials securely and handle password hashing.

**Tasks:**
1. Integrate JWT authentication middleware.
2. Implement user login and registration endpoints.
3. Secure sensitive routes using authentication middleware.
4. Update documentation to include authentication instructions.
